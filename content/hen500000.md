# HEN 500000

[Inspired by 500k OBJKTs on HEN](https://twitter.com/hicetnunc2000/status/1455922956442476553), this piece represents both the number 500000 and the ever changing landscape of art. 
Eventually everything will dissolve and reappear in another dimension.

It's also the first ever NFT by NERDDISCO.

## Details

When [LiveJS](https://twitter.com/livejs_network) started to work on the intro peformance for [JSConf India 2021](https://www.jsconf.in/) from 30. - 31.10 in Habmurg, the idea of a Mandala style visual came immidiately into my mind. I found this awesome "[Infinite Mandala](https://codepen.io/shubniggurath/pen/Qooevz) by [Liam Egan](https://codepen.io/shubniggurath)" (MIT license), converted it into [ISF](https://isf.video/) to have every parameter accessible, added a circle + flower shape and made it audio-reactive by using AudioFFT [in JS](https://github.com/vcync/interactive-shader-format-js/tree/feat/ISFAudio) (thanks to [Sam Wray](https://github.com/2xAA)).
