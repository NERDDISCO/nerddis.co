# nd-xmas-001

My friends Patrick and Jasmin run a co-working space in Mainz and every year they host their christmas-party in there with all their friends. Jasmin asked me if I could provide some decoration for the 2022 party to make it look more xmas-like. As I had nothing analog to bring, I created a winter wonderland in ThreeJS, which was projected onto a wall in their office. 

You can check it out yourself and maybe use it for your party if you like it:

## Resources

This project is based on these resources:

* [White Fir Trees Collection Photoscanned For Cycles (CC 4.0)](https://blendermarket.com/products/white-fir-trees-collection-photoscanned-for-cycles) by Michal Sornat from which I used one tree, scattered it on a box in Blender, exported it as GLTF
  * The needle-texture was altered by adding some snow ontop of it
  * The bark-textures where resized to 50% of their size + transformed from png to jpg to make them smaller
* [Snow 02 (CC 0)](https://polyhaven.com/a/snow_02) by Rob Tuytel was used for the ground
* [Snowy Forest Path 01 (CC 0)](https://polyhaven.com/a/snowy_forest_path_01) by Oliksiy Yakovlyev used as the environment map
* [Randomised Fractal Snowflakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXTC5LSep3M) was used to generate a random  Snowflake-Texture
* [2a How to make falling snow three.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXpl8durSjA) inspired the particle system to animate the snow so that it falls from the sky
