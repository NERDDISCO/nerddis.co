# nd-genuary32nd-plants-chatgpt3-001

{{< attention url="https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/nd-genuary32nd-plants-chatgpt3-001" name="fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/nd-genuary32nd-plants-chatgpt3-001" >}} 

For [Genuary](https://genuary.art) 2023 (= Generative art in January, a month where you have a different prompt every day and can use that to create art in any form you like) I wanted to create something, but had no idea what I could actually do. At the same time I was playing around with ChatGPT and started to discover, that it can be used to create code. When my friend 2xAA released his new album "Alescere", I finally got the inspiration I needed: The cover contains a plant and my first thought as: How would this look like if it would actually grow? Which fits in perfectly with the "plants" prompt of Genuary 2023.

A human talks with a robot via text messages. They both want to create something awesome.
