November 2022, we celebrate 1 year of fxhash ðŸŽ‰

1 year = 365 days of

* generative art
* excitement
* collaboration
* freedom
* support
* fun
* peace
* fairness
* harmony

365 days exist because of a seed on fxhash.

The fxhash-box at the bottom is using a reverse-engineered version of [FXHASH Generative Logo](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/fxhash-generative-logo) (the first piece ever minted on fxhash) with special thanks to [@ciphrd](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/ciphrd) for being so kind to allow me to use it. The whole technique is described in [Pattern formation using Dividing-Aggregating Walkers](https://ciphrd.com/2021/03/17/pattern-formation-using-dividing-aggregating-walkers).

Everything is generated with ThreeJS, the fxhash logo is encoded in base64. 


## Problem: Safari (Browser)

There is a hack for Safari on iOS (iPhone & iPad) to not crash the generative token on page reload. I hope this will not explode in the future once this problem is resolved in WebKit, but let's keep our fingers crossed, shall we?
