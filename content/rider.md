# Rider

All the things that NERDDISCO needs in order to perform at your event. If not mentioned otherwise, everything from this page is required. 

## Basic

* 1 x table with at least 1m width, 1m depth and 1m height
* 1 x bar stool
* n x bananas (1 banana for each hour performing)
* 1 x multi-plug with at least plugs (Type F, EU)
* 1 x HDMI cable to connect to the projector / TV
* 2 x XLR male or 6.3 mm jack to receive the stereo audio signal from the audio mixer of the DJ


## Lights

* 1 x DMX cable (3 pin XLR male) to connect my DMX512 controller
* floor plan with all fixtures (model + vendor) + their addresses + channels
  * This is delivered at least one week before the event so that the fixtures can be added into my lights software

If the venue is using Art-Net, then I'm not sure if this is working with my setup, I only ever did this once and there it was not working. So in order to be sure that this is fine, we would need at least a check of 3 hours on a different day to confirm that my setup is working. If this is not possible, then I will just do visuals. 


## Recommended setup

* Venue has projector / TV already in place and I can just connect to this via HDMI
* Venue has lights (controllable via DMX512) installed and I can just use them

If this is not possible, please contact me at least 4 weeks before the event so that we can plan alternatives


## Tech check

* I bring my computer + other gear (MIDI controller, audio interface) at least 2 hours before the event starts 
* Check the audio signal with my audio interface
  * It's required that someone is playing audio while this is happening
* Check the video signal with my visuals software
  * It's required that the projector / TV is turned on while this is happening
* (optional) Check the DMX signal with my DMX controller
