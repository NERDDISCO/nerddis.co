This year I'm participating in this challenge called [Advent of Writing 2025](https://adventofwriting.lovable.app/) to write one blog post every day until December 24th 2025.

My topic this year is [Runpod Flash](https://github.com/runpod/tetra-rp) (just "flash" from now on), a new Python SDK that we have developed at Runpod to make it easy for people to develop custom serverless endpoints for any model without leaving their local environment.

This series starts with a guide on getting started with flash and then explores a different open-weight model from Hugging Face each day, showcasing how it works with flash.
