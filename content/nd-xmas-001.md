# nd-xmas-001

My friends Patrick and Jasmin run a co-working space in Mainz and every year they host their christmas-party in there with all their friends. Jasmin asked me if I could provide some decoration for the 2022 party to make it look more xmas-like. As I had nothing analog to bring, I created a winter wonderland in ThreeJS, which was projected onto a wall in their office. 

You can check it out yourself and maybe use it for your party if you like it:
